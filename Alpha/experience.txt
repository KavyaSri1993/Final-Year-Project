Name: Krishna, Experience: Recently, I underwent a phishing attack where I received a fraudulent email that appeared to be from my bank. The message prompted me to click on a link and enter my personal information.

Name: Deepa, Experience: I recently received an email that looked like it was from a popular online shopping site. The message said my account was compromised and urged me to click a link to verify my information. The email was very convincing, with the company's logo and professional language. However, before clicking, I noticed the sender's email address was slightly off. I decided to investigate further and found that the website linked in the email was fake. Thankfully, I didn't enter any information, but it was a scary reminder of how easily these scams can appear legitimate.
